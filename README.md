# Node_REST_Api
In this project I will be creating a REST API using Node.js.
It will be a simple api but with a lot of features such as authentication and etc.
The api will have two major routes:
1. /products
2. /orders

Further details on the project will be updated down the lane.
PS: If time permits, I will build a react-native app too to consume the api.
Thanks for reading!
